# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks - Chapter 4 - Haskell

## Day 1 - Self-Study

### Find:

- [ ] The Haskell wiki
- [ ] A Haskell online group supporting your compiler of choice

### Do:

- [ ] How many different ways can you find to write `allEven`?
- [ ] Write a function that takes a list and returns the same list in reverse.
- [ ] Write a function that builds two-tuples with all possible combinations of two of the colors black, white, blue, yellow, and red. Note that you should include only one of `(black, blue)` and `(blue, black)`.
- [ ] Write a list comprehension to build a childhood multiplication table. The table would be a list of three-tuples where the first two are integers from 1-12 and the third is the product of the first two.
- [ ] Solve the map-coloring problem using Haskell.
