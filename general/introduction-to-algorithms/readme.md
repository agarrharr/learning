# Introduction to Algorithms

## 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing

### 1.1 Algorithms

1. Give a real world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

    Sorting- showing a bar chart from large to small.

    Convex hull- simplified geometry for collision detection.

    Convex hull- [computing ingredients in a recipe](http://veronising.blogspot.com/2008/04/cooking-for-nerds-ingredient-polyhedron.html).

    Convex hull- computing the shortest path around an obstacle.

2. Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

    Memory usage.

3. Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

    JavaScript objects- Strengths: flexible (it can store any type and you can access values by the name of their key. Weaknesses: properties don't have an order.

4. How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

    The traveling-salesman problem has to find a path between all nodes, but the the shortest-path problem finds the shortest path between 2 nodes. The traveling salesman-problem is NP-complete, and shortest-path is known polynomial-time. But there are similar, because they both find a path between nodes.

5. Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

    Only the best solution will do- reconcile a bank account.

    Approximately best is good enough- recommend books to read.
